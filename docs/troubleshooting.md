# Troubleshooting

## Add-on does not appear after installation

- Make sure you selected the **original** `scan2brush.zip` file.  
  Do **not** extract it before installing.
- Confirm that:
  - Blender version is **4.0.1** (or compatible),
  - You installed the add-on via **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install…**

## macOS security warning

On macOS, Blender might be blocked by the system the first time you run it.

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
2. Allow Blender to run (you may need to click **Allow Anyway** or similar).

## Blender cannot access folders

If Scan2brusH cannot read or write to certain directories:

- Check that you have permissions for the target folder.
- On macOS, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Files and Folders**  
  and ensure Blender has access to the relevant locations.

## Unexpected behaviour on first use

If the add-on does not behave as expected:

- Confirm that you:
  - Installed the add-on from the `scan2brush.zip` file.
  - Enabled it in **Preferences → Add-ons**.
  - **Restarted Blender** after the first installation.
