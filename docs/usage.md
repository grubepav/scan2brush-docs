   - Recommended import settings (scale, orientation).
3. **Core workflow steps**  
   - Preparing the jaw model.  
   - Working with splints / appliances.  
   - Exporting final geometry for manufacturing.
4. **Tips and best practices**  
   - Recommended naming conventions.

   - Backing up project files.

You can add as many subpages as needed under this `Usage` section,
for example:

- `usage-splints.md` – working with splints  
- `usage-export.md` – exporting data for labs
